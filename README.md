# Post-Management

A React + Vite starter application for managing posts.  
This project uses a modern, minimal setup powered by Vite and React, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), linting, Tailwind CSS, and a ready-to-go workflow.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Built using React (functional components, hooks)  
- Vite as build & dev tool — blazing fast start-up & rebuilds  
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling  
- ESLint for code quality and consistency  
- Minimal, clean project structure — easy to extend  
- Ready for CRUD or post-management workflows

🎨 Styling & Design
Tailwind CSS is included and configured via tailwind.config.cjs.
Global styles are imported in index.css.
For additional components/pages, place them under src/components/ or create a pages/ folder if you wish.
You can customise the Tailwind theme (colours, fonts) via the config file.



🔧 Customisation & Extensions
    1.To add routing, install and configure react-router-dom:
      npm install react-router-dom

   For state management, you may add @reduxjs/toolkit or Context API depending on needs.
   To enable absolute imports, modify vite.config.js:
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
    
    export default defineConfig({
      resolve: {
        alias: {
          '@': '/src',
        }
      },
      plugins: [react()]
    });


1.If you wish to enable the React Compiler (experimental) for further optimisation,
follow the official guide: React Compiler Installation



✅ Best Practices
  1.Keep components small & reusable—preferably < 200 lines.
  2.Use consistent naming (e.g., PascalCase for component filenames, camelCase for folders/variables).
  3.Keep your ESLint configuration up-to-date and resolve warnings immediately.
  4.Write meaningful commit messages and maintain a clean project history.
  5.Add tests (Jest/React Testing Library) if you plan for production or collaboration.


🧮 Deployment
  1.Build the project via npm run build.
  2.The dist/ folder is ready for static hosting.
  3.You can deploy to platforms like:
  4.Vercel
  5.Netlify
  6.Cloudflare Pages
  7.GitHub Pages (if configured)
  8.Ensure any environment variables or API endpoints are configured for production.
